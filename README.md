## Welcome rTMS-scholar

This is the home of `rTMS-scholar`, a comprehensive database for scholarly literature on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

### What is rTMS scholar?

rTMS scholar is a database for scholarly literature about repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. 

Its coverage is restricted to:
- rTMS studies, where repetition rate ≥ 1 Hz
- experiments performed on human participants (both healthy and patients)
- peer-reviewed articles that can be identified via PubMed

We exclude studies:
- magnetic seizure therapy
- peripheral (extracephalic) rTMS studies

### What is the motivation of rTMS scholar?

The main motivation of rTMS scholar is to organize the methodological information from peer-reviewed articles that investigate the motor, cognitive, affective, electrophysiological and neurophysiological effects and aftereffects of various forms of rTMS including patterned protocols such as theta burst stimulation (TBS). rTMS scholar aims to facilitate rTMS research by providing a better methodological overview about the increasing number of rTMS studies. 

### How can rTMS scholar facilitate research? 

Every study is a unique work on its own. However, peer-reviewed rTMS articles share - to some extent - common features, parameters and practices, according to which they can be organized. rTMS scholar allows researchers to gain an overview about wide range of methodological parameters used in the rTMS literature. 

### Implementation of rTMS scholar
The rTMS scholar is implemented in R, library ProjectTemplate: http://projecttemplate.net/getting_started.html
Each module has a data folder. Each article is associated with an excel sheet (XLSX format) and stored in a particular module folder. 

### Status of rTMS scholar
The development of rTMS scholar started in December 2018. rTMS scholar is under intense development at the moment.
